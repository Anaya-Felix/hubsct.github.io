this game is about how much trash is being put in the ocean and how we can stop it. the planet is pollute with pollution and oil. the turtles are a big part and are dying more then we expect. this game is about how we should help the turtles. to play you will have to click as much turtles as you possibly can in 60 seconds. Thank you for playing and supporting girls who code.</p>
