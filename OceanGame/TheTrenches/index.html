      <center><p1>Welcome to the trenches of the ocean! It sounds depressing, I know. But life down here is much more fascinating than you might think at first... </p1>

      <center><p2>The trenches of the ocean, also known as the oceanic trenches, are chasms in the ocean floor. These are the deepest parts of the ocean, and some of the deepest natural sections of the world. Now you would think that the trenches would be pure misery, but despite the deepness and darkness, it is also full of life.</p2>

      <center><p3>Sea creatures down in the trenches can get quite... iNtErEsTiNg. From the Barreleye Fish to the Deap-sea Hatchetfish, the looks of these animals are very diverse and unlike anything you've ever seen on land and will ever see on land, that's for sure.

      <center><p4>But sadly, some of these creatures are suffering. Debris, such as rubber, plastic, metal, wood, and cloth, sink down, all the way down to the trenches. These materials can endanger the lives of not only the animals, but the plant life, too. But you can help, even just from your own home! You can do things like buying energy efficient light bulbs to use less energy, or cutting down on how much you throw away by recycling instead! Every small thing you do makes a difference :)
