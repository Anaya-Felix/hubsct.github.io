  <h1>How to Play</h1>
  </center>
  <P>This game is a collection of smaller games, going from "The Trenches" to "The Beach".</P>
    <p>On each game, you must first click on the Green Start Flag in the middle of the game screen for the game to start. You should receive individual instructions for each level after hitting the Green Flag.</p>
    <p>If you want to see the entire map of the levels of the ocean, you can return to the Home Page to go back to the beginning and see all the levels you need to complete.</p>
    <p>You can go to the next level or skip a game if needed, by using the "Next level" button below it.</p>
    <p>We wish you luck in saving the ocean! And hope you have as much fun playing this game as we had putting it together!</p>
