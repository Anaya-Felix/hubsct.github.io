			<b>How did you get the Trashion Piece Name?</b>
			I got my trashion piece name from my flowered white fabric.<p></p>
			<b>How did you get the idea?</b>
			I got my idea for White Blossoms because i thought the fabric was so pretty and as soon as i saw it, I had a vision.  It took many plans to perfect it, and I'm really happy with the final design.<p></p>
			<b>What materials did you use?</b>
			I used one sheet of recycled fabric, one of my white shorts, and another recycled item, a blue mesh strip.<p></p>
			<b>How much money do you want for this?</b>
			I would put White Blossoms up for about $1,500.<p></p>
			<b>What have you learned?</b>
			I have learned how to use a sowing machine during this process, to work with what you have, and there is beauty in everything, but sometimes its just hard to find.<p></p>
