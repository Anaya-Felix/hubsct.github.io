			<b>How did you get the Trashion Piece Name?</b>
			I got the name because of the color of the fabric and the 'flow' of my outfit.<p></p>
			<b>How did you get the idea?</b>
			I got the idea by thinking in a different perspective. I knew that the jumpsuit would look better when cut into a top and bell bottoms. Also, I loved the fabric/color and design of it.<p></p>
			<b>What materials did you use?</b>
			For my outfit, I used a jumpsuit which I cut into a top and bottom. Some materials that were used were a needle, thread, sewing Machine, ribbon, mesh, scissors, pencil, rulers, and more.<p></p>
			<b>How much money do you want for this?</b>
			None, I'm keeping it for myself.<p></p>
			<b>What have you learned?</b>
			I have learned how to sew, make headbands, thread a needle/machine, and much more.<p></p>
